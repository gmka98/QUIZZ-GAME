# QUIZZ GAME

In this code, I created a simple quiz game using Python. The game begins by welcoming the user and asking if they are ready to play. If the user responds with anything other than "yes", the game quits. Otherwise, the game starts and the user is prompted with a series of questions.

For each question, the user inputs their answer and the code checks if their answer is correct. If the answer is correct, the code prints "Correct!" and increments the user's score. If the answer is incorrect, the code prints "Wrong!".

After all questions are answered, the code calculates the user's score as a percentage and prints the result to the console.

I made sure to convert all user input to lowercase to avoid any issues with case sensitivity when checking answers. Overall, the quiz game is a fun way to test the user's knowledge on basic web development concepts.
